# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- When linking to something, prefer linking to the specific part of its documentation related to WebDAV.
  - For example, a web server's page explaining how to enable WebDAV is preferred over that web server's home page.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
  - If you have an app or tool that doesn't fit any category, that likely means we need a new category! Feel free to add it in the same PR.
  - Similarly, if the category is starting to feel too broad, that likely means we need to split it up!
  - If in doubt, open an issue to discuss.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
